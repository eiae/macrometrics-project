- Does the predicted target variable (idio + common) need to match the observable/GDP at the quarters (still correlation is 1)? How to transform predicted as to make it match (for plotting purposes)? For BVAR it seems to match perfectly.
- Compute correlation between predicted target from common vs from common + idio? If yes, do it at monthly or quarterly? If not, is it predicted target from common and GDP at quarterly?
- What dynamic structure to use to forecast with DFM? Use State-space equations (both transition to forecast and measurement to map)? Which standard error to simulate the economy?
