- Does the predicted target variable (idio + common) need to match the observable/GDP at the quarters (still correlation is 1)?
- Compute correlation between predicted target from common vs from common + idio? If yes, do it at monthly or quarterly? If not, is it predicted target from common and GDP at quarterly?
- If set autoregressive params of idiosyncratic component for quarterly variables/GDP to zero, run into singularity issues for Bayesian regression
